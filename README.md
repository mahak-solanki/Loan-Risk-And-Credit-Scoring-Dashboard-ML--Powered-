# Loan-Risk-And-Credit-Scoring-Dashboard-ML--Powered-

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Loan Risk and Credit Scoring Dashboard** built using **Power BI** for visualization and **Machine Learning (Python)** for risk prediction.  
The goal is to help financial institutions analyze **loan applicants**, predict **default risk**, and make **data-driven lending decisions**.

## 🚀 Features
- Loan approval & rejection trends  
- Risk segmentation of applicants (High, Medium, Low risk)  
- Income vs Loan Amount analysis  
- Credit score distribution  
- ML-powered **loan default prediction model**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI** – Dashboard & Data Visualization  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for:  
  - Data Preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature Engineering  
  - ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
